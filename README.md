### Welcome to my professional project portfolio!

***This space has been created to showcase my skills and experience in developing data-driven business solutions. My focus is on exploring the entire data lifecycle, including:
* Data ingestion and storage: Leveraging modern tools to efficiently capture and organise data.
* Data modelling and processing: Applying cleaning and transformation techniques to prepare data for analysis.
* Visualisation and statistical analysis: Designing intuitive dashboards and advanced statistical models to support strategic decision-making and address real business challenges.
My goal is to demonstrate how data can be transformed into valuable insights to drive business outcomes.***

My journey into the world of data began in 2020, following a professional experience in Portugal as a mechanical engineer. It was during this time that I realised how essential it is for any business aiming to thrive in the future to swiftly and effectively implement data-driven solutions. Digital transformation is not merely a trend but a necessity to ensure a healthy and competitive presence in todayâ€™s market.

During university, I developed a passion for technology and programming, delving into languages such as Python and SQL. I rediscovered how rewarding it is to create something practical and functional from just a few lines of code â€” blending logic and creativity to turn ideas into reality.

Since then, I have been continually enhancing my skills across all stages of developing data-driven solutions. This encompasses everything from gaining a deep understanding of business problems to deploying models in production, using a variety of analytical tools and cloud computing technologies.

I invite you to explore this portfolio, learn more about my work, and collaborate with me. Feel free to share ideas, suggestions, or new solutions.

Enjoy!
