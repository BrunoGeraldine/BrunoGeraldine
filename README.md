# **Bruno Geraldine**

**Data Scientist**

I have been studying data science and machine learning since 2020, when, after a journey outside Brazil working as a mechanical engineer, I could see how we are still juniors in this journey of data, analytics, insights and big data. In college I got to know the industrial automation process and was able to remember how fun it is to work with programming and see the result of a few lines typed in a program being transformed into something real and practical.

I have improved myself in all stages of developing a business solution using Data Science concepts and tools, from understanding the business to publishing the model in production using Clouds.

I'm developing some solutions to important business problems like data insights and sales forecasting and still building myself as a data scientist.
